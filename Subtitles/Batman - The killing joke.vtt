00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.915
<i>First of all,</i>

2
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.590
<i>I realize this is probably
not how you thought the story would start,</i>

3
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.910
<i>not with a big shiny moon</i>

4
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.992
<i>or a city that could look
stunning in spite of itself.</i>

5
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.075
<i>Or me.</i>

6
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.112
<i>But I wanted you to know
that before the horror began,</i>

7
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.635
<i>before it all came crashing down,</i>

8
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.917
<i>there was a time when capes
and cowls and fighting crime</i>

9
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.672
<i>really was exciting.</i>

10
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.630
<i>I'd been with Batman
for almost three years.</i>

11
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.475
<i>That night my father signaled
for him, so something was up.</i>

12
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.834
<i>I tend to stay out of these discussions.</i>

13
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.991
<i>I mean, why push my luck?</i>

14
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.238
<i>- You there?</i>
- Yeah.

15
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.193
We've got a robbery.

16
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.240
Bloody son of a...

17
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.113
You act like you've never been
in a police chase before.

18
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.833
- Take the next left.
- Here?

19
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.515
Here.

20
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.759
We've got to lose the truck.

21
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.036
Let's lose the cops instead, okay?

22
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.870
This is going to be a night to remember.

23
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.429
Fricking A!

24
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.879
Caution, falling debris.

25
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.078
Okay, we lose the truck.

26
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.589
You really want to turn
a robbery into a murder?

27
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.552
You see another way out of this?

28
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.036
I know you're in a bad spot.

29
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.348
But there's bad and then there's worse.

30
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.195
Like that.

31
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.595
Negotiating?

32
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.909
He wasn't going to hurt me.

33
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.274
Did he know that?

34
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.109
Sometimes, you have
to have a little faith.

35
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.794
What happened to the drivers?

36
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.279
They got away.

37
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.634
But the night's still young.

38
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.349
I'm going to need some alone time.

39
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.236
Oh, sure, yeah.

40
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.594
Maybe I'll see you...

41
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.275
Later.

42
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.309
It's a lot of photos.

43
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.557
My uncle's big on family,
even the ones he's hit.

44
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.158
His Holiness is expecting us.

45
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.478
Get the hell in here.

46
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.398
It's all over the news.

47
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.676
<i>Every channel.</i>

48
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.275
What can I tell you? Batgirl's hot.

49
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.671
Don't get smart.

50
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.391
<i>I lost four men yesterday.</i>

51
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.879
Four idiots.

52
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.873
They said they could
knock out the tracker on the armored car.

53
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.349
I don't think they could plug
a computer in their ass.

54
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.159
Do I care?

55
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.198
I'm out 100 grand,
thanks to your frigging fiasco.

56
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.719
And what do I get for it?

57
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.872
The Bat and his bitch
breathing down my neck.

58
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.588
<i>Bottom line, you're going to give me
my money back, nephew, every cent.</i>

59
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.028
Otherwise you're going to become
a very distant relative, very soon.

60
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.200
<i>Capisce?</i>

61
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.274
Okay, unc, whatever you say.

62
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.754
Darker men, huh?

63
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.200
Barbara, why didn't you tell me?

64
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.920
I have a cousin who's a defense attorney.

65
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.076
Ooh, Reese, not that dark.

66
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.637
He's single.

67
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.560
Well, that lightens him up
a bit, doesn't it?

68
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.914
Babs, girl,

69
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.416
I do not understand
why you're having fishing troubles

70
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.237
when we are in the middle of a lake.

71
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.356
<i>What do these guys have
to do to get your attention?</i>

72
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.315
Steal a book?

73
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.989
It just so happens
I'm involved with someone.

74
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.270
Sort of, kind of.

75
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.280
That serious, huh?

76
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.440
What are you doing?

77
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.989
My dad's department
has been setting up city cams.

78
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.593
I've been helping with the program.

79
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.752
It's amazing. You can view
half of Gotham from your computer.

80
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.793
Looks like a bad boy, just your type.

81
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.915
Jesus, Paris, a friggin' fortune
in the middle of some dump.

82
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.115
It's ridiculous.

83
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.998
It used to be a bank.

84
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.958
The same family's owned
this building since 1929.

85
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.031
- Which family?
- My uncle's.

86
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.233
You are bloody crazy.

87
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.435
You sound pissed.

88
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.313
- No, I sound freaked the "F" out.
- I'm not.

89
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.878
And that's freaking me, too.

90
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.316
My uncle's a dinosaur, Lonny.

91
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.552
By the time he finds out
what we've done, he'll be extinct.

92
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.517
No withdrawals today, boys.

93
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.999
Bloody hell, it's her!

94
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.873
Batgirl, I am impressed.

95
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.911
Where's your overbearing boyfriend?

96
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.354
He's not my boyfriend.

97
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.352
Then maybe I have a chance.

98
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.919
What are you doing?

99
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.559
I want to meet her.

100
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.709
Awesome.

101
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.240
I don't want to have to hurt you.

102
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.960
Why should you be different
from all the other girls?

103
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.709
It's like a dance.

104
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.074
Yeah, right.

105
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.596
Too bad we can't sit this one out.

106
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.916
I don't waste my time with punk amateurs.

107
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.674
Oh, baby, I think you've misjudged me.

108
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.400
Smells like cherries, huh?

109
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.677
You've got maybe
10 seconds to bedtime, baby.

110
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.831
Can't end the night without a kiss.

111
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.710
You'll never make it to the door, Batgirl.

112
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.557
Smart girl.

113
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.395
She's taking a nap. Let's grab the money.

114
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.674
Thanks.

115
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.788
How long was I out?

116
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.555
A few minutes.

117
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.915
Apparently, I got there
right after they left.

118
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.152
You should've waited for me.

119
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.469
They were on their way out.

120
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.198
I had to do something.

121
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.109
His name is Paris, Paris Franz.

122
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.793
You're kidding?

123
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.155
I guess not.

124
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.673
Your father gave me his file.

125
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.190
He's a nasty combination
of narcissist and sociopath.

126
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.079
He'll have you smiling right up to
the moment he cuts your throat.

127
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.517
I haven't had to deal
with his type of crazy in a while.

128
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.833
I don't want you to, either.

129
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.753
What are you saying?

130
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.672
Don't go near him without me.

131
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.876
- Excuse me?
- No matter what.

132
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.837
We're not exactly attached at the hip.

133
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.069
We are on this.

134
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.714
You want to work with me,
you do what I say.

135
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.793
And that's it?
You speak and the words are law?

136
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.269
Yes.

137
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.880
<i>Let me understand.</i>

138
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.270
<i>You're seeing a guy,
but not really dating.</i>

139
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.351
- Right.
- In a yoga class.

140
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.635
Basically.

141
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.398
He's, like, the instructor?

142
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.595
Right.

143
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.233
And he's making demands?

144
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.198
He's always been controlling,
usually I'm okay with it.

145
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.360
But there's no sex?

146
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.714
God, no!

147
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.791
<i>And you're into him because...</i>

148
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.039
Because of the yoga.

149
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.715
I like the yoga.

150
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.678
So, find another class.

151
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.913
There is no other class, Reese.
This is it.

152
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.080
And I'm good.

153
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.238
He won't say it,
but I'm the best damn student he ever had.

154
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.868
So, if he's going to start
making decisions based on emotions

155
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.519
of which he has zero,

156
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.716
then I think we've got a problem!

157
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.750
And they say the gay scene
is complicated. What?

158
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.393
Here you go, ladies,

159
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.915
added token of our appreciation.

160
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.195
Here's the mask
your buddy wanted me to wear.

161
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.635
Sorry,
we had to cut up the pillowcase.

162
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.433
Got it, thank you.

163
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.239
You know I've got real masks
back at the house,

164
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.509
just saying.

165
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.313
So, how long are we going to be here?

166
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.478
I thought you Brits liked the salt air.

167
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.757
I don't like all that money
sitting under a friggin' sink.

168
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.271
- Feed it to the fish.
- What?

169
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.796
I just got access
to every offshore account my uncle owns.

170
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.794
And she called me an amateur.

171
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.800
Who is it?

172
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.960
It's your uncle.

173
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.635
How do we get out?

174
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.518
You're looking at it.

175
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.150
<i>Batgirl, I'm afraid
I didn't get your number.</i>

176
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.710
<i>So I'm sending this video
to the police to give to you.</i>

177
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.798
<i>They've got to be good for something.</i>

178
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.673
<i>You may have heard
that I've come into some family money.</i>

179
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.279
<i>I told you I'm no punk.</i>

180
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.035
<i>In fact, I got you a gift.</i>

181
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.751
<i>Something special for my special girl.</i>

182
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.392
<i>Just go back to where we met. You'll see.</i>

183
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.113
- Cute.
- It's not cute. It's a trick.

184
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.396
I know, but it is a little flattering.

185
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.198
No, he doesn't know you.

186
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.879
He's objectified you.

187
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.278
When a criminal gets personal like that,
it's bad news.

188
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.389
You're off this one.

189
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.229
- What?
- I don't want you on this case.

190
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.229
At all? So he likes me, we can use that.

191
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.719
He's not afraid of you.

192
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.438
I want him nervous.

193
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.716
The place you met was
at that warehouse, right?

194
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.592
Yeah. Where are you going?

195
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.439
Your father and his men
are already canvassing the place.

196
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.919
I'll let you know what we find.

197
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.911
Hold on, we're not done.

198
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.435
No, wait. Wait!

199
00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.800
<i>Hey!</i>

200
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.994
Is this the gift?

201
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.991
'Cause I thought I was
a little more special.

202
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.629
<i>You are, baby.</i>

203
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.115
<i>But the real gift's somewhere else.</i>

204
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.550
<i>Girls like scavenger hunts, don't they?</i>

205
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.632
Is this going to take long?

206
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.399
<i>Careful getting in.</i>

207
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.238
<i>I don't own this place yet.</i>

208
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.798
<i>You're getting hot, hotter.</i>

209
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.154
<i>Whoa, you might have to call
the fire department.</i>

210
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.431
- Where's the gift?
<i>- Come on, look around.</i>

211
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.199
<i>You're the girl detective.</i>

212
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.592
<i>For you, my love.</i>

213
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.313
Do you realize what you've done?

214
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.391
He was the biggest boss in Gotham.

215
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.558
He was an artifact.

216
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.359
He went out with phone booths
and the porkpie hat.

217
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.516
I'm the next evolution, baby.

218
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.395
Today, it's all about brains
and nerve and tech.

219
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.152
That's how I got his money

220
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.760
<i>and that's how I'm going to get you.</i>

221
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.000
<i>Boss, you okay in there?</i>

222
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.280
- You might have to get in line.
<i>- Break it down.</i>

223
00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.080
You let him play you.

224
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.516
He thinks he knows you, like there's
some kind of relationship going.

225
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.511
He led you like a lap dog.

226
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.551
Bull, I knew what I was doing.

227
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.597
I was on the hunt, same as you.

228
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.876
No, you were trying to prove something.

229
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.032
You let your ego cloud your judgment.
You should've listened to me.

230
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.634
- I thought we were partners.
- We are.

231
00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.753
But we're not equals, not even close.

232
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.150
You sanctimonious, self-righteous...

233
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.390
You're not in it like I am, Barbara.

234
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.240
It's still a game for you,
it's still a thrill.

235
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.992
You haven't been taken to the edge yet.

236
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.548
The edge of what?

237
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.153
The abyss,

238
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.356
the place where you don't care anymore.

239
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.078
Where all hope dies.

240
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.990
We're done here. You're off the case.

241
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.713
No! This isn't over.

242
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.440
You can't dismiss me
with some metaphysical BS.

243
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.999
Why are you doing this?

244
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.832
- I told you.
- Uh-uh.

245
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.032
We've been up against worse threats
than Paris Franz.

246
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.317
This isn't about me, it's about us.

247
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.432
It's about you getting protective
and sitting in judgment.

248
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.199
I won't have it!

249
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.909
Then get out.

250
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.435
How dare you!

251
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.718
I'm in this because of you!
I did what you wanted.

252
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.995
I made it work!

253
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.274
Barbara Kathleen Gordon,
what the hell have you done?

254
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.956
So, you and yoga guy?

255
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.396
Yeah, a few nights ago.

256
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.114
Girl, you've been holding out. How was it?

257
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.230
- Not so good?
- No, it was fantastic...

258
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.032
Like fireworks.

259
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.200
Yeah?

260
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.555
Except he's been avoiding me.

261
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.631
At least, I think he is.

262
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.869
We haven't talked.

263
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.234
I've been to that dance.

264
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.952
Maybe it was too soon,
even after all this time.

265
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.952
Talk to him, Babs.
Some guys need a period of adjustment.

266
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.310
They get nervous about commitment.

267
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.674
He's only human, right?

268
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.549
<i>In local news,
the city is bracing for gang wars</i>

269
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.269
<i>following the murder of crime boss,
Carlos Francesco, Saturday.</i>

270
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.671
<i>At the same time, the manhunt
goes on for Parry Francesco,</i>

271
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.400
<i>aka Paris Franz, the murder suspect.</i>

272
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.158
<i>Said Detective Harvey Bullock,</i>

273
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.440
<i>"It's like he's fallen off
the face of the Earth... "</i>

274
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.993
From your lips, Harvey.

275
00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.510
But I tried to be what you want.

276
00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.080
You're not listening to me, Debbie.

277
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.556
So damn clingy.
I feel trapped, like I can't move.

278
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.279
I need space.

279
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.949
Hey, hey, hey!

280
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.550
There... Space.

281
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.191
So, what do you think?

282
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.439
Is it worth a shot?

283
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.789
I'm doing it, anyway.

284
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.869
Hey.

285
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:05.710
Hi, nothing on cable tonight, so I thought
I'd get out and get some exercise.

286
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.190
Tell me, how's Paris these days?

287
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.554
<i>He's on the move.</i>

288
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.752
We got a tip
he might be hiding out at the docks.

289
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.239
That's where I am right now.

290
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.031
That wouldn't be an invitation, would it?

291
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.200
<i>No.</i>

292
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.992
I was just kidding,

293
00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.479
but I'm not that far away.

294
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.640
No.

295
00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.439
<i>But what about after you get him?
What then?</i>

296
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.599
Are we back in business?

297
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.279
Oh, come on!

298
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.668
<i>We'll talk later.</i>

299
00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.838
It was just sex for God's sake.

300
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.360
It doesn't have to mean anything.

301
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.160
It's not like we have to care,
I don't care.

302
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.437
You don't care.
We just go back like it was. That's all.

303
00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.908
<i>Please.</i>

304
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.029
Later.

305
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.675
Bang on, mate!

306
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.588
Take the other side.

307
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.239
Alone at last.

308
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.875
Selfish, foul, piece of garbage!

309
00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.672
You ruined everything!

310
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.676
Must be that time of the month.

311
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.148
<i>Thanks to Batman,
Franz was taken into police custody,</i>

312
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.515
<i>ending an intensive city-wide search.</i>

313
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.551
<i>This was the scene earlier today
as he was taken into arraignment.</i>

314
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.915
<i>Love you, Batgirl. Love you.</i>

315
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.669
Batgirl.

316
00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.320
Close.

317
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.714
I thought I'd save you
the trouble of ending this.

318
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.511
There's some stuff you might want back.

319
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.273
Can't have smoke bombs
exploding in the apartment.

320
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.553
I'm sorry, it's just that...

321
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.757
I get it. It's one thing
to protect the city,

322
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.309
another when it
narrows down to one person.

323
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.113
Someone you really care about.

324
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.711
I'll find some way to fill my time.

325
00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.958
It's just as well, you know.

326
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.034
I saw that abyss you spoke about,

327
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.192
very scary, but so tempting.

328
00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.032
<i>I don't know how you resist it.</i>

329
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.918
I don't think it's humanly possible
after a while.

330
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.954
Be careful.

331
00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.673
<i>And that was that.</i>

332
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.230
<i>Oh, I'd see him again,
but never as Batgirl.</i>

333
00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.271
<i>I really was done
with that part of my life.</i>

334
00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.588
<i>A week later, it wouldn't matter anyway.</i>

335
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.637
<i>A terrible storm was moving in</i>

336
00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.836
<i>and we'd all be in for it by then.</i>

337
00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.559
Hell of a night, huh?

338
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.234
What makes it different
from any other night in Gotham?

339
00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.718
Nothing, nothing at all, I suppose.

340
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.995
Commissioner Gordon, uh,
he thought you might like to see this.

341
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.352
- That's an interesting choice of words.
- Come again?

342
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.516
Why would I "like" to see this?

343
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.800
Huh.

344
00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.311
Well, I guess "need"
would have been better for you, right?

345
00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.876
<i>Coroner came and gave things the eyeball.</i>

346
00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.357
<i>Says these poor saps died
probably three years ago.</i>

347
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.555
Died?

348
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.679
Well, we won't know for sure if they was
murdered till after the autopsies.

349
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.319
They were murdered.

350
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.433
What do you make of this?

351
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.791
What do I make?

352
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.515
Well, three years ago
was that dentists' convention.

353
00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.797
The one where a handful of conventioneers
never returned home,

354
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.155
just went missing.

355
00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.880
Emptied out their bank accounts
and disappeared.

356
00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.389
I think we're standing
in the mouth of that.

357
00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.472
It's an interesting
choice of words, huh?

358
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.916
Tell Gordon
I'd like to talk to him.

359
00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.600
Well, I would,
but tonight's his father-daughter night

360
00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.829
and you know he doesn't...

361
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.115
Have to be there.

362
00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.311
Tell Gordon I need to talk...

363
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.720
To him.

364
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.278
- Hello?
<i>- Barbara, it's Dad.</i>

365
00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.953
Oh, hi, Dad, how's your day?

366
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.639
<i>Not over yet, unfortunately.</i>

367
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.736
<i>I'm sorry, honey,
but I won't be able to make it tonight.</i>

368
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.637
<i>- Something's come up.</i>
- Are you all right?

369
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.836
<i>I'm fine, there's nothing
for you to worry about.</i>

370
00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.632
<i>A friend asked me for a favor.</i>

371
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.949
A friend?

372
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.588
<i>Yes, honey, that friend.</i>

373
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.390
You mind telling me what this is about?

374
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.315
Listen to me.

375
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.789
He's been in custody for two years.

376
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.797
If we can prove what we found today...

377
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.230
- He'll confess.
- He's insane.

378
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.550
It's a mistake to think
you know what he'll do.

379
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.996
I'm not here
because of what was found today.

380
00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.351
I'm here because I need to be.

381
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.994
Hello, I want to talk.

382
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.556
I've been thinking lately
about you, you and me.

383
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.792
About how this is going to end.

384
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.031
About who will end up killing who.

385
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.035
Perhaps, you'll kill me,
perhaps I'll kill you,

386
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:38.150
perhaps sooner, perhaps later,
you know that, don't you?

387
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.757
I just, I need to know,

388
00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.990
for when that time comes,

389
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.277
that I'd made a genuine attempt
to talk things over,

390
00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:54.319
to try and avert the inevitable,
just once.

391
00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.952
Listen to me, this is life and death,

392
00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.878
mine or yours.

393
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.113
Our relationship, it's fatal.
I don't want your murder on my...

394
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.949
Hey, wait a minute.
I've got rights.

395
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.913
You ain't allowed to touch me!

396
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.353
Where is he?

397
00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.112
Do you realize what you've set free?

398
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.750
What it's capable of?
Do you have any idea?

399
00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.229
Where is he?

400
00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.040
- Dear God, open that door!
<i>- Get off of me!</i>

401
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.680
What do you think you're doing?

402
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.592
You know the laws
about mistreating inmates.

403
00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.796
If you harm one hair on his head...

404
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.233
Now, you stinking little stain!

405
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.472
I'm going to ask you politely,
one last time.

406
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.834
Where is he?

407
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.838
<i>Ah, there you are.</i>

408
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.750
<i>So, had enough time
to look over the property?</i>

409
00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.678
It's what you're looking for?

410
00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.196
Well, it's garish, ugly
and smells like piss.

411
00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.148
Can't quite make out
whether it's bums or rats, but it's piss.

412
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.357
I'm a connoisseur
when it comes to eau de toilette.

413
00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.999
As for the rides,

414
00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.154
any innocent little child
getting on one could be maimed or worse.

415
00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.198
So you don't like it?

416
00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.278
Don't like it?

417
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.994
I'm crazy for it!

418
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.196
Okay, okay, that's great.

419
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.716
So the price, with what you've
mentioned, we can negotiate.

420
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.875
No need to, sure your price is steep,
but as I look around,

421
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.072
all I can see is I'll be making a killing.

422
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.915
And money? Not a problem.

423
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.994
Not anymore.

424
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.716
How'd it go? Did they like your act?

425
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.672
Well, they, uh...

426
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.638
They said they might call me.

427
00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.716
I got nervous and blew a punch line.

428
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.760
Oh.

429
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.594
What do you mean, "Oh"?

430
00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.871
I didn't mean anything.

431
00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.999
Yes, you did,
the way you said "oh" like that.

432
00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.838
Jesus, all I said was...

433
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.149
You said, "Oh."

434
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.856
As in, "Oh, so you didn't get the job?"

435
00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.313
As in, "Oh, I should've known?"

436
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.755
As in, "Oh, so how are we going
to feed our baby?"

437
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.195
You think I'm not worried about that?

438
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.795
You think it's all a big joke to me?

439
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.389
I have to go up on stage

440
00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.994
and nobody laughs.

441
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.878
And you think I don't care.

442
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.679
You think, you think...

443
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.872
Oh, God! Oh, God! I'm sorry!

444
00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.796
I don't mean to take this out on you.

445
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.598
You're suffering enough,

446
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.637
being married to a loser.

447
00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.352
- Honey, that's not...
- Yes, it is true.

448
00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.677
I can't support you.

449
00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.075
Oh, Jeannie.

450
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.039
Shh. It'll be okay.

451
00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.555
The baby won't be here
for another three months.

452
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.280
Mrs. Berkis will let us slide
on the rent a little longer,

453
00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.078
she feels sorry for me.

454
00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.318
She hates me.

455
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.917
She comes out in the hallway to scowl
at me every time I take the stairs.

456
00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.592
That smell like cat litter and old people.

457
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.030
I've just got to get you out of here
before the baby comes.

458
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.032
All I need is enough money
to get us set up in a decent neighborhood.

459
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.235
For crying out loud,

460
00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.238
there are girls on the street
who earn that in a weekend

461
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.068
without having to tell a single joke

462
00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.838
or blow a punch line.

463
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.435
Come here and stop worrying about us.

464
00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.194
I love you, job or no job.

465
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.834
You're good in the sack
and you make me laugh.

466
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.280
<i>Let me tell you something.</i>

467
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.356
You ain't going to regret
buying this place.

468
00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.152
It ain't as bad as it looks.

469
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.431
I hope you're wrong about that.

470
00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.917
Come on, a little spit and polish,

471
00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.116
you'll have yourself
one hell of a carnival.

472
00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.118
Oh, you are so right,

473
00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.953
and thanks to your smooth salesmanship

474
00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.113
and your silver tongue,
I'm completely sold.

475
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.633
Let's shake on it.

476
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.871
Sure, sure, it's my privilege.

477
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.600
Yes, yes, it is.

478
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.474
Who are they?

479
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.473
Spit and Polish, my attorneys.

480
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.632
They persuaded your partner
to sign over the deed about an hour ago.

481
00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.916
The property's already mine.

482
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.512
I can see that you're happy about that.

483
00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.113
Now, I must dash.

484
00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.113
There's equipment to rent,
plus workers to hire,

485
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.113
and of course,
I need to secure my main attraction.

486
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.396
Uh, do feel free to stick around.

487
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.709
Your refreshments, Master Bruce.

488
00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.595
Well, then, sir,

489
00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.797
do you need my further assistance
or should I just go away?

490
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.353
That'll be fine.

491
00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.114
Trying to figure out
what he intends to do.

492
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.236
It's almost impossible.

493
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.358
Excuse me if I find that comforting, sir.

494
00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:09.834
I don't know him, Alfred.

495
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.319
<i>All these years and I don't know who he is
any more than he knows who I am.</i>

496
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.238
Are you sure of that?

497
00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.640
What do you mean?

498
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.155
I mean don't underestimate him.

499
00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.589
I don't and neither should he
underestimate me.

500
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.715
You can't save everyone, sir.

501
00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.274
He drives me.

502
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.989
<i>How can two people hate so much
without knowing each other?</i>

503
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:46.635
I hate this. Whenever we jail him, I pray,
"Please, God, just keep him there."

504
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.273
And then when he escapes, it's,

505
00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.908
"Please don't let him
do something too awful this time."

506
00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.080
I hate it.

507
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.630
Dad, just once, could you leave
your work at the office and relax?

508
00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.599
I made you some cocoa.

509
00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.593
Thanks, but tonight
I could use something a little stiffer.

510
00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.310
You know, I found that
Catwoman scrapbook you couldn't.

511
00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.072
It was behind the wardrobe.

512
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.319
You really ought to let me work
out a filing system for you,

513
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.318
something like we use at the library.

514
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.559
Mmm-hmm.

515
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.629
Oh, look.

516
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.394
You've got paste squidging out,
don't get it on your pants.

517
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.949
Barbara, I swear,
you're fussier than your mother was.

518
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.232
That must be Colleen. She's early.

519
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.549
We're going to work out.

520
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.416
You'll have to entertain her
while I get ready.

521
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.637
Look at this one.
First time they met.

522
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.633
He was just robbing banks then. Remember?

523
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.917
What I remember is you describing
his white face and green hair.

524
00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.230
I was just a kid,
scared the hell out of me.

525
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.936
I thought you'd be interested.

526
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.191
Yeah, well, I had some
really interesting nightmares.

527
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.400
Barbara!

528
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.434
<i>I wouldn't worry yet,
if I were you.</i>

529
00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.830
It's just a psychological manifestation,

530
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.831
common among librarians.

531
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.355
<i>She thinks she's a coffee table edition,</i>

532
00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.432
though I can't say much
for this volume's condition.

533
00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.676
I mean there's a hole in the jacket

534
00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.798
and the spine appears to be damaged.

535
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.157
You scum, I'll...

536
00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.640
Will you?

537
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.837
Refreshing to hear, not by the book.

538
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.437
Speaking of which, this one won't be
walking off the shelf anytime soon.

539
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.195
In fact, the idea
of her walking anywhere seems remote.

540
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:46.148
But then, that's always
a problem with softbacks.

541
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.514
Oh, God,

542
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.877
literary discussions
can get so dry, can't they?

543
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.238
Finish the Commissioner, take him where he
needs to be and please, do be careful.

544
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.551
After all, he is topping the bill.

545
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.113
It really is a shame you'll miss
your father's debut, Ms. Gordon.

546
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.714
Sadly, our venue wasn't built

547
00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.711
for the disabled in mind.

548
00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:13.589
Why are you doing this?

549
00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.558
To prove a point.

550
00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.873
Here's to crime.

551
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.033
You see, I have a reason, a good one.

552
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.152
I have to prove myself...

553
00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.790
As a husband and a father.

554
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.359
I mean, well, this isn't the sort of thing
I'd agree to do normally,

555
00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.351
without an important reason.

556
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.760
Of course.

557
00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.919
Did I ever tell you
I started out as a lab assistant?

558
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.354
Of course, I did, right?

559
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.836
<i>A good job, a real good job,
but my heart wasn't in it.</i>

560
00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:54.228
So, I quit to be a comedian,
to make people laugh

561
00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.470
because when they laugh, they feel good.

562
00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.029
The thing is... They didn't.

563
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.468
Now I'm not feeling good.

564
00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.029
That's why I'm here, for one big score!

565
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.236
Hey, can you try and be cool?

566
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.269
Sorry, I usually don't drink at lunchtime.

567
00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.670
You're not lying when you say
we'll get away with it?

568
00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.632
Nobody will know I was involved?

569
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.274
Not to worry, friend.
We'll take care of you.

570
00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.201
We need your help getting into that
chemical plant you used to work in

571
00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.350
and into the playing card company
next door.

572
00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.676
It's your expertise we appreciate.

573
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.628
And to absolutely guarantee
ain't nobody connects you to the robbery,

574
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.072
you'll be wearing this.

575
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.711
Wait a minute,

576
00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.791
I've seen that before in the papers.

577
00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.796
That's the Red Hood's mask.

578
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.757
He raided that ice company last month.

579
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.638
Smarten up, wise guy.

580
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.358
There ain't no Red Hood.

581
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.035
Just a bunch of guys
like yourself and a mask.

582
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.760
Right, the most valued member of the crew,

583
00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.428
he gets to wear it, no questions asked.

584
00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.033
'Cause he needs the...

585
00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.270
"He can't afford to be
connected to the job

586
00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.238
"so he deserves additional anonymity."

587
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.515
Merits it.

588
00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:07.110
Sure. That makes sense, right? That's you.

589
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.838
But there aren't any eye slits.

590
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.319
How am I supposed to see?

591
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.511
Well, therein lies the beauty.

592
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.672
Two-way mirrors,
just like the cops use, huh?

593
00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.469
I don't know, I don't know.

594
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.478
That chemical plant...

595
00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.518
I quit 'cause it creeped me out.

596
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.832
So grim and ugly,
it was getting under my skin.

597
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.116
But you know it
like the back of your hand.

598
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.395
Right.

599
00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.118
But this ain't about you, though.

600
00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.513
No. No, of course not.

601
00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.273
Just this once,

602
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.112
then I can lead a proper life.

603
00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.429
Exactly.

604
00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.200
Can't make a nest
without breaking a few eggs.

605
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.871
That's funny.

606
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.191
No, it's cliche.

607
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.473
So, 11:00, Friday night,

608
00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.400
friend?

609
00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.551
Starting Saturday morning, I'll be rich.

610
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.917
Just trying to imagine that,
my life, completely changed.

611
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.551
Nothing will be the same...

612
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.718
Not ever again.

613
00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.191
She'll never walk again.

614
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:04.955
I'm sorry.

615
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.673
Some woman found Ms. Gordon,
name of Colleen Miles.

616
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.671
She found the, uh, victim
in a state of undress.

617
00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.468
Undress?

618
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.912
They didn't tell you?

619
00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.399
Pretty sick, ain't it?

620
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.478
Leave us alone for a moment.

621
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.111
Barbara, I don't know if you can hear me.

622
00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.240
Batman?

623
00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.989
Batman.

624
00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.231
He took Dad, he...

625
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.599
Oh, God! I remember.

626
00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.235
Barbara, take it easy. It's okay.

627
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.992
No, no, it's not okay.

628
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.436
<i>He's taking it to the limit this time.</i>

629
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.875
You didn't see his eyes.

630
00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.833
He said he wanted to prove a point.

631
00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.156
Said Dad was top of the bill.

632
00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.118
What's he going to do?
What's he going to do to my father?

633
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.551
Huh? What?

634
00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.599
- Wait!
- Up!

635
00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.630
Stop!

636
00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.800
Up!

637
00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.040
<i>No, no!</i>

638
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.833
Don't, please.

639
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.558
Why are you doing this?

640
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.038
Where are you taking me?

641
00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.360
- Down!
- What?

642
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.999
Down!

643
00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.997
Please, tell me what I'm doing here.

644
00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.639
Somebody!

645
00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.915
<i>Doing?</i>

646
00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:02.914
You're doing what any sane man in your
appalling circumstances would do.

647
00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.073
You're going mad.

648
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.350
I remember.

649
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.715
<i>I wouldn't do that.</i>

650
00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.269
Remembering's dangerous.

651
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.989
I find the past such
a worrying, anxious place.

652
00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.756
Yes, memory is so treacherous.

653
00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:25.630
One moment you're lost in a carnival
of delight, childhood aromas,

654
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.870
<i>the flashing neon of puberty,</i>

655
00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:31.077
all that sentimental candyfloss.

656
00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:35.558
The next, it takes you
somewhere you don't want to be.

657
00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.790
Somewhere dark and cold,

658
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.278
filled with damp, ambiguous-shaped things
you'd rather forget.

659
00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:46.389
<i>Memories can be vile,
repulsive little brutes.</i>

660
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.438
Like children, no?

661
00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.388
Barbara.

662
00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.996
But can we live without them?

663
00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.549
Memories are what our reason is based on.

664
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.632
If we deny them, we deny reason itself.

665
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.598
Although, what's wrong with that, really?

666
00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.957
It's not like we're contractually
tied down to rationality.

667
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.358
There is no sanity clause.

668
00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.919
So when you find yourself

669
00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.435
locked onto an unpleasant
train of thought,

670
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.229
headed for places in your past
where the screaming is unavoidable...

671
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:24.155
Remember this, there's always madness.

672
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.629
You can just step outside,

673
00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:30.753
<i>close the door on all
those dreadful things that happened.</i>

674
00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.629
You can lock them away forever.

675
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.040
So, everything's
settled for tonight?

676
00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.553
We can count on you?

677
00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.430
Uh... Well, of course.

678
00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.397
It'd be crazy to back out now.

679
00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.918
I mean, the worst part,
lying to Jeannie, that's done.

680
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.272
She thinks I have a club engagement.

681
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.835
No reason she shouldn't
keep right on thinking that.

682
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:04.396
Now, about tonight,
wear a suit and a bow tie.

683
00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.518
It's kind of the trademark
with this Red Hood business.

684
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.114
It's what Jeannie
will expect me to wear to the night club.

685
00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.599
Ah! It's perfect.

686
00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.879
Excuse me, sir?

687
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.508
Could we speak to you outside
for a moment?

688
00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:23.789
Me? But why? I haven't, I mean, uh...

689
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.718
It'll only take a moment, sir.

690
00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.596
Something you want to tell us, friend?

691
00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.076
There was an accident this morning...

692
00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.312
Testing the baby bottle heater.

693
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:16.113
An electrical short and my wife died.

694
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:21.517
Gee, that's terrible. We're really sorry.

695
00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.918
The cops said it was
a million-to-one shot accident.

696
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.432
Said I should probably have another drink
before I went to the hospital.

697
00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.749
And you should.

698
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.509
Rough break, man,
probably want to be alone, right?

699
00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.789
That's cool.

700
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.592
We'll see you back here tonight.

701
00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.269
Tonight?

702
00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.035
I can't.

703
00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.276
There's no reason anymore.

704
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.874
Jeannie's dead.

705
00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.952
Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry about your wife,

706
00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.918
but what's happening tonight,
it's no little thing.

707
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.634
And we can't ensure that
anybody backing out remains healthy.

708
00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.872
- Uh, but...
- No buts and no exceptions.

709
00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.952
Look, tomorrow you bury
your old lady in luxury.

710
00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.071
Tonight, you're with us.

711
00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.072
Get the picture?

712
00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.918
I'm going to count to 10.

713
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.992
One, nine...

714
00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.356
I swear to God, man, he ain't been around.

715
00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.232
Swear to me!

716
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.357
You! I swear to you.

717
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.796
When he escapes, it ain't long till he
comes around, recruiting, you know?

718
00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.110
But not this time. Nobody's seen him.

719
00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.909
Yeah?

720
00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.878
Step away from the door.

721
00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.594
Oh, shit.

722
00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.309
You done?

723
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.311
<i>- Yeah, I heard he got out again.</i>
- You heard?

724
00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.075
Read.

725
00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.478
Calm down, I have no idea where he is

726
00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.835
or what in the hell
he's got planned, trust me.

727
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.479
I can't trust you.

728
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.432
No, but believe me.

729
00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.438
If I knew anything, I'd tell you, honest.

730
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.039
People in my, uh...

731
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.519
Let's call it "line of work."

732
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.869
Criminals.

733
00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.713
Yeah, we may be scared of you.

734
00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.798
We're terrified of him.

735
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.635
Order in the court! Order in the court!

736
00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.279
I'll have ham on rye.

737
00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:23.072
It doesn't have to be good
to be a classic.

738
00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:27.235
So, Commissioner, I need your help.

739
00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.879
Is that why I'm here?

740
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.871
That's why you're here right now,

741
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:34.476
like right now, as in this moment.

742
00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.393
Do me a favor and live in it, okay?

743
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.835
Anyway, me and my colleagues,
we couldn't come up with

744
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.309
one sound mind and body between us.

745
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.948
So, we're counting on yours.

746
00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.312
What should be done with someone
who has no regard for the law?

747
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.789
- Yeah!
- He's right.

748
00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.554
Someone who treats people like meat!

749
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.629
A man who has no problem
brutalizing his fellow man to get his way.

750
00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.995
- Now, now.
- What would you do to a man

751
00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.879
who breaks the laws
you are sworn to uphold?

752
00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.157
A monster who ignores
everything you stand for!

753
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.949
Come on, is it that bad?

754
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:12.158
Yes, it is, and if it were up to me...

755
00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.628
Right now, it is.

756
00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.912
I'd throw the book at him.

757
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.320
Throw the book!

758
00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.671
Throw the book!
Throw the book! Throw the book!

759
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:34.035
What are you waiting for?
Throw it! Throw it!

760
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:38.075
<i>Throw it! Throw it!</i>

761
00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.514
Throw the book!

762
00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.518
Right on target.

763
00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.033
Truth is, Commissioner,

764
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:49.715
the man on trial here,
you consider your friend.

765
00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.950
Nope, which is funny.

766
00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.155
Funny?

767
00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.914
Yeah, he usually comes
around here, right away.

768
00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.513
Like before it's even on the news,

769
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.830
he broke out of the nuthouse again,
he's had a roll.

770
00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.998
You'd think the most important
thing for him is to...

771
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.674
What?

772
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.397
Have a good time.

773
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.990
So, why do you think
he hasn't been to visit?

774
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.400
I don't know.

775
00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.437
Maybe, he found himself another girl.

776
00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.477
Hey, somebody wants you.

777
00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:32.548
<i>Uh-uh-uh. No fair hiding.</i>

778
00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.038
<i>Ugh. Well, I'd see why.</i>

779
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.555
<i>You don't look so good.</i>

780
00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:45.150
<i>Well, I don't blame you, not when that
bowl of cherries some call life,</i>

781
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.158
<i>turned out to be the pits of hell.</i>

782
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.439
<i>Perhaps, a song might
bring a smile to your face.</i>

783
00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.714
<i>When the world is full of care</i>

784
00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.474
<i>And every headline screams despair</i>

785
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:08.078
<i>When all is rape,
starvation, war and life is vile</i>

786
00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.798
<i>Then there's a certain thing I do</i>

787
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.793
<i>Which I shall pass along to you</i>

788
00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:20.318
<i>That's always guaranteed to make me smile</i>

789
00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.597
<i>Yes!</i>

790
00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:26.230
<i>I go loony</i>

791
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.273
<i>As a light bulb-battered bug</i>

792
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.352
<i>Simply loony</i>

793
00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.114
<i>Sometimes foam and chew the rug</i>

794
00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.716
<i>Mister, life is swell in a padded cell</i>

795
00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:41.678
<i>It'll chase those blues away</i>

796
00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.513
<i>You can trade your gloom for a rubber room</i>

797
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.069
<i>And injections twice a day</i>

798
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:50.392
<i>Just go loony like an acid casualty</i>

799
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.916
<i>Or a Moonie or a preacher on TV</i>

800
00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:02.108
<i>When the human race wears an anxious face</i>

801
00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.757
<i>When the bomb hangs overhead</i>

802
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.593
<i>When your kid turns blue</i>

803
00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.399
<i>It won't worry you</i>

804
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:14.313
<i>You can smile and nod instead</i>

805
00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.358
<i>When you're loony</i>

806
00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:20.239
<i>Then you just don't give a fig</i>

807
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.676
<i>Man's so puny</i>

808
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.149
<i>And the universe so big</i>

809
00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:27.878
Barbara? No!

810
00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.672
<i>If you hurt inside, get certified</i>

811
00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:32.599
<i>And if life should treat you bad</i>

812
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.199
Barbara! Barbara!

813
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:37.955
<i>Don't get even, get mad</i>

814
00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.350
Barbara!

815
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:41.874
Yes!

816
00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.110
Ah, here they are now.

817
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:08.269
Holy Christ! That must be
the best ghost train in the business.

818
00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.756
I mean, when they went in,
the fellow in the middle

819
00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.235
didn't look a day over 17.

820
00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.554
Well, that's what
a dose of reality will do to you.

821
00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.229
It's why I never touch the stuff.

822
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:23.751
I find it waters down the hallucinations.

823
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.034
So, Commissioner, how's things?

824
00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.912
Commissioner? Hello? Anybody home?

825
00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.191
Oh. This wasn't supposed to
turn out boring.

826
00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.830
Oh, put him away in his cage.

827
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.752
We're about to open for business.

828
00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:47.272
Let's hope our main
attraction gets livelier.

829
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.432
Give him time to reflect upon life

830
00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:54.752
and all its random uncontrollability.

831
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.070
<i>Hey, quit your
daydreaming, friend.</i>

832
00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.355
<i>It's showtime.</i>

833
00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.991
I was just remembering.

834
00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.680
I used to walk along here
to work each morning.

835
00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:13.637
Ah, that's good, real good.

836
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.472
That's just what we need you to do.

837
00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.640
Just guide us through
this stinking factory

838
00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:19.870
so we can get to the joint next door.

839
00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:23.157
And stay far away from us
while we do the dirty work.

840
00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:27.109
It's like we're practically giving you
money by cutting you in on this.

841
00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.474
Right now?

842
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.153
Will I be able to breathe?

843
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.639
Not if you smoke.

844
00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.838
That's a good one.

845
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.675
Maybe, I should be looking into your line
of work instead of you looking into mine.

846
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.758
You got a funny shaped head.

847
00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.918
Maybe I should've been a clown
instead of a comedian.

848
00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:45.310
There. You can see, friend?

849
00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:48.115
<i>Yeah, but everything's red,</i>

850
00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:51.239
stuffy too and it smells.

851
00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:52.839
Ooh, my voice sounds echo-y.

852
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.594
Then shut up and get to work.

853
00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.870
Okay, we go through here
past the filter tanks

854
01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.077
and then Monarch Playing Cards
is just beyond the partition.

855
01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:09.035
<i>You know this place looks
even worse in red.</i>

856
01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.110
- It looks like...
- Hey, you! Freeze!

857
01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.680
Come on, come on, get 'em up!

858
01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.416
Murph, get some men over to the rear bays.

859
01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.396
We're being robbed by the Red Hood Mob.

860
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.109
You asshole!
You said there was no security.

861
01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.296
They must have altered things
since I left.

862
01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.709
It's so loud.

863
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.917
For God's sake, run!
This is all screwed up, run!

864
01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.400
Man, which way?

865
01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.232
I can't see where I'm going.

866
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.277
You useless son of a bitch.

867
01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.559
I'm not the guy you want.

868
01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.995
It's him! He's our ringleader.

869
01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.593
He's the Red Hood.

870
01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.559
He's pulling a gun!

871
01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.752
No, no, no, no, no!

872
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.480
Stop!

873
01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.399
No more shooting.

874
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.911
I'll take care of this my way.

875
01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.917
It's that human bat guy.

876
01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.435
Dear God,
what did I do to deserve this?

877
01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.113
So, Red Hood,

878
01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.758
we meet again.

879
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.430
Stay away from me,
don't come any closer, you monster!

880
01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:27.750
Uh, uh...

881
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.914
It burns!

882
01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.953
I'm itching all over. What's...

883
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.715
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

884
01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.030
<i>although there doesn't
seem to be either here.</i>

885
01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.668
<i>How about children of all ages?</i>

886
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:05.113
<i>You must have received your free ticket.
Oh, I'm so glad.</i>

887
01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:33.632
Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages,

888
01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.872
I give you the average man.

889
01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.712
Impressive, eh?

890
01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.438
Ooh!

891
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.709
Jim.

892
01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.797
Jim, are you still...

893
01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.834
Oh, God. Oh, God.

894
01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.115
It's okay, let it come.

895
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.915
He showed me pictures of my daughter.
Have you seen her?

896
01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.239
Yes, she's alive.

897
01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.515
And?

898
01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.432
The police are right behind me.

899
01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.749
I'll stay with you, until...

900
01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.275
No, I'll survive.

901
01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:31.555
Go after him. I want him brought in.

902
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.711
And I want it done by the book.

903
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.152
By the book!

904
01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.912
You have to!

905
01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.517
We have to show him our way works.

906
01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.871
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

907
01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.477
<i>What does it matter if you send me back to
the asylum if it doesn't matter to me?</i>

908
01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.278
I've proved my point.

909
01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.198
Gordon's been driven mad.

910
01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:12.110
<i>I've demonstrated there's no difference
between me and everyone else.</i>

911
01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:17.029
<i>All it takes is one bad day.</i>

912
01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.549
<i>That's how far the world
is from where I am,</i>

913
01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.790
just one bad day.

914
01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.472
<i>You had a bad day once, am I right?</i>

915
01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.915
<i>Oh, I know I am.</i>

916
01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.149
<i>I can tell.</i>

917
01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.153
<i>You had a bad day and everything changed.</i>

918
01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:34.631
<i>Dressing up like a flying rat
doesn't hide it, it screams it.</i>

919
01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.354
<i>You had a bad day
and it drove you as crazy</i>

920
01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:40.671
<i>as everybody else,
only you won't admit it.</i>

921
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.056
<i>You have to keep pretending</i>

922
01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.195
<i>that life makes sense,</i>

923
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.794
<i>that there's some point
to all this struggling.</i>

924
01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.076
<i>You make me want to puke.</i>

925
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.430
Shh.

926
01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.309
<i>I mean, what is it with you?</i>

927
01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.119
<i>What made you what you are?</i>

928
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.228
<i>Girlfriend killed by the mob, maybe?</i>

929
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.311
<i>Brother carved up by some mugger?</i>

930
01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.232
<i>Something like that, I know.</i>

931
01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.631
<i>Because something like that
happened to me.</i>

932
01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.473
<i>Sometimes, I remember it one way,
sometimes another.</i>

933
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.871
<i>If I'm going to have a past,</i>

934
01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.873
<i>I prefer it to be multiple choice.</i>

935
01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.033
<i>My point is...</i>

936
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.439
I went crazy.

937
01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:40.228
And I'm smart enough to admit it.

938
01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.518
Why can't you?

939
01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.513
By clinging to reality, you're denying
the reality of the situation.

940
01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.388
I mean, do you ever think
about how many times

941
01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.838
we've come close to World War III over
a flock of geese on a computer screen?

942
01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.472
Silly goose, it's all a joke,

943
01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:07.674
everything anybody's ever valued
or struggled for, it's monstrous.

944
01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.673
Why can't you see the funny side?

945
01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.957
Why aren't you laughing?

946
01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.517
Because I've heard it before,

947
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.434
and it wasn't funny the first time.

948
01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:35.032
I spoke with Commissioner Gordon
before I came in here.

949
01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.635
He told me he wanted
this done by the book.

950
01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.399
You know what that means?

951
01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:43.235
It means that despite all your sick,
cruel, vicious little games,

952
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.516
he's as sane as he ever was.

953
01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.553
So, ordinary people don't crack.

954
01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.799
Maybe it's just you.

955
01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.439
No!

956
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.832
God damn it.

957
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.274
Well, what are you waiting for?

958
01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:27.716
Kick the hell out of me
and get your standing ovation.

959
01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.714
Come on!

960
01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.356
No, not this time.

961
01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.559
I don't want to hurt you.

962
01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.673
I don't want either of us
to end up killing the other.

963
01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.592
But we're running out of alternatives.

964
01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.271
Perhaps it all hinges on tonight.

965
01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.313
I don't know what it was
that bent your life out of shape,

966
01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:54.040
but maybe I've been there, too.

967
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.152
Maybe we could work together.

968
01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.072
I could rehabilitate you.

969
01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.790
You don't need to be alone.

970
01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.951
We don't have to kill each other.

971
01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.152
Let me help you.

972
01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.794
I'm sorry, but no.

973
01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.070
No, it's far too late for that.

974
01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.829
You know, it's funny.

975
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.278
This reminds me of a joke.

976
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.150
See, there were two guys
locked in a lunatic asylum

977
01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:42.471
and one night, one night they decided
they didn't like that anymore.

978
01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.153
They decided to escape.

979
01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.856
So, they made it up to the roof and there,

980
01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.235
just across this narrow gap,
they see rooftops,

981
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.517
stretching across town,
stretching to freedom.

982
01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.314
Now, the first guy,
he jumps right across, no problem.

983
01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:58.115
But his friend, no way,
he's afraid of falling.

984
01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.236
So, the first guy, he has an idea.

985
01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.318
He says,
"Hey, I got this flashlight with me.

986
01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.516
"I'll shine it across the gap
between the buildings

987
01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.399
"and you can walk across
the beam and join me."

988
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.120
But the second guy says,
"What do you think I am, crazy?

989
01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.477
"You'll just turn it off
when I'm halfway across."

990
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.072
Excuse me.

991
01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.114
Hmm.

992
01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.713
Yeah, Dad, I just got back
from the lacrosse game.

993
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.675
Going to practice
some Wallball this weekend.

994
01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.519
Getting pretty good.

995
01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.155
Maybe another night, Dad,
I got plans tonight.

996
01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.115
I can't help it
if your daughter's so popular.

997
01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.113
I'll talk to you, later.

998
01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.919
Right then, back to work.
